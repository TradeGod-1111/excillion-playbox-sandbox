# Excillion Playbox (Sandbox)

Purpose: prove our GitHub flow (Issues → PRs → CI) and host tiny, testable artifacts:
- Playbooks (process over prediction)
- Risk-as-code (limits)
- Research (toy backtest via GitHub Actions)

## How to see results
Open the **Actions** tab after a push or PR, click the latest run, and download the artifact `backtest-artifacts`.
